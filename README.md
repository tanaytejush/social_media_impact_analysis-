# social_media_impact_analysis-
This project explores how social media addiction affects students' lives, focusing on its impact on academic performance, sleep, and mental health. Using data analysis and visualization, it uncovers patterns that show the real-world consequences of excessive screen time in a student‚Äôs daily routine.

üìä Project Overview
This project analyzes how social media usage impacts students' academic performance, mental health, and sleep habits.
By exploring real-world data, the project uncovers patterns that highlight both the boon and threat of social media in modern student life.

The study uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, and statistical tests to better understand student behavior related to social media addiction.

üìà What I Did
Cleaned and explored a dataset on students' social media habits.

Created correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, boxplots, and regression lines for visualization.

Performed independent t-tests to find statistically significant differences between students affected by social media and those who are not.

Conducted correlation analysis to see how addiction relates to sleep and mental health.

Summarized findings into actionable insights to raise awareness about digital behavior.

üí° Key Insights
Most Addictive Platforms:
Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat showed higher addiction scores compared to others. This highlights where students are spending most of their digital time.

Academic Performance Impact:
Students who reported that social media affects their academics actually had higher daily usage and addiction scores. This was statistically proven using t-tests.

Sleep and Mental Health Correlation:
There is a negative correlation between social media addiction and sleep/mental health. Students who are more addicted to social media tend to sleep less and report poorer mental health.

Mental Health vs Addiction:
The data clearly showed that as addiction increases, mental health decreases. This highlights a real emotional and psychological cost of excessive online engagement.

‚ö° The Light Side:
Social media helps students stay connected, learn new things, and express their creativity. It‚Äôs a tool for networking, sharing ideas, and exploring the world beyond classrooms.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Dark Side:
But when it‚Äôs overused, it can drain focus, disturb sleep, and harm mental health. It often leads to endless scrolling, unhealthy comparisons, and procrastination that affect daily life.

"The things we give our attention to shape how we experience life‚Äîmoment by moment. This project is just a gentle reminder to be more mindful of how we use social media, especially while we're still growing and figuring out who we are."
